2;MainQuest;In the late evening, the day before u will reach your destination you stopped in the middle of the huge forest. Rumors says that many magical creatures lifes here. You and a few other merchants sat by the campfire, the dim glow casting a comforting ambiance. Empty bottles of cheap alcohol scattered around, remnants of joviality and shared stories. Suddenly, your ears caught noises emanating from the nearby bushes. Your attention sharpened, but it seemed the others either ignored the sounds or remained oblivious.”. ;null;2;Go check it;Death;0;You are probably drunk and missheard this;MainQuest;-1;;;;;;
3;MainQuest;After few others sips you passed out…;null;1;continue;Wagoon;0;;;;;;;;;
0;Wagoon;You are abruptly awakened by loud screams. As you open your eyes, you find yourself inside the wagon, protected by a canvas cover. In the dim light, you recognize the faces of two men—Stefano and Roberto. The terror etched on their faces mirrors the chaos unfolding outside. The air is thick with panic, and the distant sounds of commotion grow louder with each passing moment. It becomes evident that something grave has befallen the caravan, shattering the peaceful night's slumber.”;null;3;(whisper) What in the name of gods is happening. Why everyone screams?;Wagoon;-1;exit wagoon;OldSword;0;(Scream)!!;Death;0;"""""";Death;0

5;MainQuest;When u hear that there’s no enemies nearby, you leave a wagoon with your companions. It’s easy to tell that they do not like this idea, but they are realy trying to be as sneaky as possible. You still hear screams all the time. You can see movment on the other side of the camp, nearby a tent, where women and children were sleeping. On the other side of the camp u can see mercenaries that were supposed protect you it looks like they are fighting against something. Enemies kinda looks like huge human-like dogs with armor, and simple weapon. It seems like you its your choice to say where you go;null;3;”follow me” (go help women and children) ;WrongWay;0;”follow me” (try to hide behind mercenaries);Death;0;”Follow me” (run into a forest);MainQuest;-1;;;
0;OldSword;You gather all your courage and quickly exit the wagon, leaving Stefano and Roberto behind. As you step out, a horrifying scene unfolds before your eyes. Human-like dogs armed with crude weapons roam about, hunting down people. In an instant, one of them locks eyes with you, a malicious grin spreading across its face. You realize that your only chance of survival is to engage in a fight.;null;1;continue;OldSword;-1;;;;;;;;;
